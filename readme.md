## This is a leapfrog.

This leapfrog loves reading the news and hates !@#$ paying for it.

## This leapfrog decided to stop !@#$ paying the New York Times for news.

To be like this leapfrog, all you have to do is:
* Clone the repo 
* Visit chrome://extensions
* Check "Developer Mode" at the top if it isn't already
* Click "Load unpacked extension"
* Upload this folder
* Read NYTimes articles fo' free, fo'eva

## How does it work?

It's the exact same logic lifted from the anonymously published Remove NYT Cookies bookmarklet, but I got tired of clicking the fucker every time NYTimes decided to ruin my life. So, I made a Chrome extension that clicks it for me. You'll only notice it when it occasionally reloads a NYT article, to clear the cookies when you've reached your limit.

## Why don't you just publish this extension and save me all the butthurt?

Because it expressly violated Google's TOS. You're a big boy/girl. You can do it. I believe. The leapfrog believes.
