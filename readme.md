## This is a leapfrog.

This leapfrog loves reading the news and hates !@#$ paying for it.

## This leap frog decided to stop !@#$ paying the New York Times to read the news

To be like this leapfrog, all you have to do is:
1. Clone the repo 
2. Visit chrome://extensions
3. Check "Developer Mode" at the top if it isn't already
4. Click "Load unpacked extension"
5. Upload this folder
6. Read NYTimes articles fo' free, fo'eva.

## How does it work?

It's the exact same logic lifted from the anonymously published Remove NYT Cookies bookmarklet, but I got tired of clicking the fucker every time NYTimes decided to stick it in my butthole. So, I made a Chrome extension that does it for me. You'll only notice it when it occasionally reloads a NYT article, to clear the cookies when you've reached your limit.

## Why don't you just publish this extension and save me all the butthurt?

Because it expressly violated Google's TOS. You're a big boy/girl. You can do it. I believe. The leapfrog believes.
